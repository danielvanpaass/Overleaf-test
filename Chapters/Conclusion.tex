\section{Conclusion}
To sum up, the group is devoted to designing a working Bomberman game for the EPO-3 project. To achieve this goal, the group is divided into several smaller groups that work on a specific part of the game. The several individually designed entities, mentioned in the report, will ultimately be combined in a higher level entity that will be the final deliverable. Communication between these smaller groups is essential, because a lot of aspects of the initial design plan can still change due to unforeseen difficulties.

For now, every member of the group knows what needs to be done and tasks are divided clearly. The team seems to work well together, and in combination with the rules and agreements that have been set up a good fundamental working environment has been created. From this point forward, the group will work towards a finalized Bomberman game.
